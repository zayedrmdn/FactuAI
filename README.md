# FactuAI

**FactuAI** is a locally deployed AI-powered application that performs:
- 📰 Automated **news summarization**
- 🔍 AI-driven **fact-checking of textual claims**

This system is being built from the ground up with **custom NLP models** trained entirely from scratch.  
It is part of my **Final Year Project** for a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence at Asia Pacific University (APU), Malaysia.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Help users **extract key insights** from long-form news articles
- Enable automatic verification of individual claims as **True**, **False**, or **Unverified**
- Promote responsible news consumption and combat misinformation through AI

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

> 🚧 This is an **active work-in-progress**. Some components (frontend/backend/model architecture) are still being tested and iterated.  
> Final structure, UI, and documentation will be updated before submission and deployment.

## 📊 Datasets

The project uses raw or lightly preprocessed public datasets, including:

- [XSum](https://huggingface.co/datasets/xsum) — For single-document news summarization
